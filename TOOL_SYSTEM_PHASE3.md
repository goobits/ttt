# Tool System Phase 3: Built-in Tools - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Phase 3 of the Tool System has been successfully implemented, providing a comprehensive set of built-in tools that users can immediately use with the AI library. These tools cover common use cases and demonstrate best practices for tool implementation.

## Implemented Built-in Tools

### 1. Web Search (`web_search`)
- **Category**: web
- **Description**: Search the web for information using DuckDuckGo API
- **Features**:
  - No API key required
  - Returns structured results (answer, summary, related topics)
  - Configurable number of results
  - Proper error handling for network issues

### 2. File Operations
#### `read_file`
- **Category**: file
- **Description**: Read contents of a file
- **Features**:
  - File size limit (10MB) for safety
  - Encoding support
  - Proper path validation
  - Error handling for permissions, encoding issues

#### `write_file`
- **Category**: file
- **Description**: Write content to a file
- **Features**:
  - Optional directory creation
  - Encoding support
  - Path validation
  - Permission error handling

#### `list_directory`
- **Category**: file
- **Description**: List files in a directory
- **Features**:
  - Pattern matching with glob
  - Recursive search option
  - Hidden file filtering
  - File size display

### 3. Code Execution (`run_python`)
- **Category**: code
- **Description**: Execute Python code safely
- **Features**:
  - Subprocess isolation
  - Configurable timeout (max 30s)
  - Automatic Python version detection
  - Output and error capture
  - Temporary file cleanup

### 4. Time Operations (`get_current_time`)
- **Category**: time
- **Description**: Get current time in any timezone
- **Features**:
  - Full timezone support via zoneinfo
  - Custom format strings
  - Helpful error messages with timezone examples
  - Default UTC fallback

### 5. HTTP Requests (`http_request`)
- **Category**: web
- **Description**: Make HTTP API requests
- **Features**:
  - All HTTP methods supported
  - JSON data handling
  - Custom headers
  - Timeout configuration
  - Pretty-printed JSON responses
  - Protocol validation (HTTP/HTTPS only)

### 6. Mathematical Calculations (`calculate`)
- **Category**: math
- **Description**: Perform safe mathematical calculations
- **Features**:
  - Basic arithmetic: +, -, *, /, **, %, //
  - Built-in functions: abs, round, pow, sum, min, max
  - Math functions: sqrt, log, log10, exp, sin, cos, tan, etc.
  - Constants: pi, e, inf, nan
  - AST-based safe evaluation (no code execution)
  - Comprehensive error handling

## Security Measures

1. **File Operations**:
   - 10MB file size limit
   - Path validation and resolution
   - No directory traversal attacks

2. **Code Execution**:
   - Subprocess isolation
   - Timeout enforcement
   - Temporary file cleanup
   - No direct eval() usage

3. **Web Operations**:
   - Protocol validation (HTTP/HTTPS only)
   - Timeout limits
   - User-agent headers

4. **Calculation**:
   - AST-based evaluation (no exec/eval)
   - Whitelist of allowed operations
   - No access to imports or system functions

## Auto-Registration

Built-in tools are automatically registered when the AI library is imported:

```python
# In ai/__init__.py
from .tools.builtins import load_builtin_tools
load_builtin_tools()
```

This ensures all built-in tools are immediately available without manual registration.

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite implemented in `tests/test_builtin_tools.py`:

- **37 test cases** covering all tools
- Mock-based testing (no real API calls or file system changes)
- Edge case coverage (errors, timeouts, invalid inputs)
- Integration tests with the tool registry
- Schema validation tests

All tests pass successfully:
```
============================== 37 passed in 1.18s ==============================
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from ai import ask
from ai.tools.builtins import web_search, calculate

# Use built-in tools directly
response = ask(
    "Search for Python 3.12 features and calculate 2^10",
    tools=[web_search, calculate]
)
```

### Using Tool Names
```python
# Tools are auto-registered, so you can use their names
response = ask(
    "What time is it in Tokyo?",
    tools=["get_current_time"]
)
```

### Complex Workflows
```python
# Multi-tool workflow
response = ask(
    "Search for Python list comprehensions, create an example, "
    "save it to demo.py, and run it",
    tools=["web_search", "write_file", "run_python"]
)
```

## Documentation Updates

The README has been updated with:
- List of all built-in tools
- Usage examples for each category
- Integration with custom tools
- Complex workflow demonstrations

## Next Steps

With Phase 3 complete, the tool system now provides:
1. ✅ Core infrastructure (Phase 1)
2. ✅ Advanced features and execution engine (Phase 2)
3. ✅ Comprehensive built-in tools (Phase 3)

Future enhancements could include:
- Additional built-in tools (database queries, email, etc.)
- Tool composition and chaining
- Async tool implementations
- Tool result caching
- Rate limiting for external API calls
