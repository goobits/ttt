# Phase 2: Core API Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Added `run_async` Utility (ai/utils/__init__.py)
- Created a reusable async-to-sync bridge function
- Intelligently detects if an event loop is already running
- Handles both standalone scripts and async environments (Jupyter, web servers)
- Provides clean error handling and compatibility with Python 3.7+

### 2. Refactored `api.py`
- **Removed**: Complex `_cleanup_aiohttp_sessions_sync` function (120+ lines)
- **Removed**: Manual event loop management and cleanup code
- **Simplified**: `ask()` function now uses `run_async` utility
- **Cleaned**: `stream()` function with cleaner loop management
- **Updated**: `ChatSession` methods to use the new pattern

### 3. Key Benefits
- Eliminated asyncio "Task was destroyed" warnings
- Reduced code complexity significantly
- Improved compatibility with async applications
- Better performance for single synchronous calls
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

## Code Reduction
- Removed ~120 lines of complex cleanup code
- Simplified event loop handling throughout
- Net reduction in complexity while maintaining full functionality

## Testing
- All existing tests pass without modification
- API behavior remains identical from user perspective
- No breaking changes to public interfaces
